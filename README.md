# Simu-Bacteria-Holograms

This code simulates a Gabor hologram obtained by illuminating a volume containing bacteria randomly arranged within it. The script saves the simulated holograms along with the position of the bacteria and their angles in a tabulated text file.  

This Python code uses the Cupy library and thus requires an NVIDIA graphics card for the computation of hologram propagation.
