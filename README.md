# Simu-Bacteria-Holograms

This code simulates a Gabor hologram obtained by illuminating a volume containing bacterias or spheres arranged within it. The script saves the simulated holograms along with the position of the bacteria and their angles in a tabulated text file.
simu_hologram_liste_bact.py, simu_hologram_liste_sphere.py, simu_hologram_random_bact.py, simu_hologram_random_sphere.py are the scripts for testing simulations

This Python code uses the Cupy library and thus requires an NVIDIA graphics card for the computation of hologram propagation.
